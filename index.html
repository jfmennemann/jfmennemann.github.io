					<strong>Abstract.</strong>
					
					This paper presents transient numerical simulations of hydraulic systems in engineering 
					applications using the spectral element method (SEM). Along with a detailed description 
					of the underlying numerical method, it is shown that the SEM yields highly accurate numerical 
					approximations at modest computational costs, which is in particular useful for 
					optimization-based control applications. In order to enable fast explicit time stepping methods, 
					the boundary conditions are imposed weakly using a numerically stable upwind discretization. 
					The benefits of the SEM in the area of hydraulic system simulations are demonstrated in various 
					examples including several simulations of strong water hammer effects. 
					Due to its exceptional convergence characteristics, the SEM is particularly well suited to be used 
					in real-time capable control applications. As an example, it is shown that the time evolution 
					of pressure waves in a large scale pumped-storage power plant can be well approximated using a 
					low-dimensional system representation utilizing a minimum number of dynamical states.

					<strong>Abstract.</strong>
					
					The design of new control strategies for the optimal dynamic operation of pumped-storage 
					power plants requires a realtime-capable mathematical model which describes the pressure and 
					volume flow fluctuations in the pipelines. 
					Classical approaches, like the method of characteristics, result in high-dimensional systems 
					of finite difference equations. 
					This paper describes the application of the spectral element method to the discretization of
					the underlying partial differential equations. 
					Special attention is put on the implementation of the boundary conditions, using a numerically 
					stable upwind discretization.
					It is shown by numerical simulation studies that the system dimension can be reduced by at least 
					one order of magnitude by the application of the spectral element method
					in comparison to the classical method of characteristics.

					<strong>Abstract.</strong>

					Ultracold gases promise many applications in quantum metrology, simulation and computation.
					In this context, optimal control theory (OCT) provides a versatile framework for the efficient
					preparation of complex quantum states. However, due to the high computational cost, OCT of
					ultracold gases has so far mostly been applied to one-dimensional (1D) problems. 
					Here, we realize computationally efficient OCT of the Gross–Pitaevskii equation (GPE) to
					manipulate Bose–Einstein condensates in all three spatial dimensions. We study various
					realistic experimental applications where 1D simulations can only be applied approximately
					or not at all. Moreover, we provide a stringent mathematical footing for our scheme and 
					carefully study the creation of elementary excitations and their minimization using multiple control 		
					parameters. The results are directly applicable to recent experiments and might thus be of 
					immediate use in the ongoing effort to employ the properties of the quantum world for technological 					applications.

			  		<strong>Abstract.</strong>
				  	Discrete transparent boundary conditions (DTBC) and the Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) method for 
					the realization of open boundary conditions in quantum device simulations are compared, based on the 	
					stationary and time-dependent Schrödinger equation. 
					The comparison includes scattering state, wave packet, and transient scattering state simulations 
					in one and two space dimensions. The Schrödinger equation is discretized by a second-order Crank-Nicolson 	
					method in case of DTBC. For the discretization with PML, symmetric second-, fourth, and sixth-order spatial 
					approximations as well as Crank-Nicolson and classical Runge-Kutta time-integration methods are employed. 
					In two space dimensions, a ring-shaped quantum waveguide device is simulated in the stationary and 		
					transient regime. 
					As an application, a simulation of the Aharonov-Bohm effect in this device is performed, showing the 	
					excitation of bound states localized in the ring region. The numerical experiments show that the results 	
					obtained from PML are comparable to those obtained using DTBC, while keeping the high numerical efficiency 
					and flexibility as well as the ease of implementation of the former method.

			  		<strong>Abstract.</strong>
				  	Transient simulations of a resonant tunneling diode oscillator are presented. 
					The semiconductor model for the diode consists of a set of time-dependent Schödinger equations 
					coupled to the Poisson equation for the electric potential. 
					The one-dimensional Schrödinger equations are discretized by the finite-difference Crank-Nicolson
				  	scheme using memory-type transparent boundary conditions which model the injection of electrons from the

					An efficient recursive algorithm due to Arnold, Ehrhardt, and Sofronov is used to implement the
				  	transparent boundary conditions, enabling simulations which involve a very large number of time steps. 		
					Special care has been taken to provide a discretization of the boundary data which is completely compatible 					with the underlying finite-difference scheme. The transient regime between two stationary states
					and the self-oscillatory behavior of an oscillator circuit, containing a resonant tunneling diode, 
					is simulated for the first time.

					<strong>Abstract.</strong>
					
					Pumped storage power plants typically feature very long hydraulic pipelines, which
					can be modeled by a set of partial differential equations. The estimation of the 
					pressure and volumetric flow along the pipes is an important task for the operation of
					such a plant. Therefore, this work compares different early- and late-lumping based
					observer designs for this system. Two late-lumping observers, a Lyapunov-based
					design and an observer using the backstepping design method, are examined. The
					Lyapunov-based approach uses a simple boundary correction to stabilize the 
					estimation error dynamics. In contrast, the backstepping-based approach allows to utilize
					additional in-domain corrections to obtain a faster rate of convergence. For the 
					implementation of these distributed-parameter observers the spectral element method as a
					flexible and computationally efficient discretization method is introduced. It is shown
					that, compared to the Lyapunov-based design, the discretization of the 
					backstepping-based design requires additional spatial grid points for the accurate approximation of
					its feedback gains. For the early-lumping approach, the spectral element method is
					used to approximate the model equations by a system of differential equations. Based
					on this approximation an Extended Kalman Filter is designed. All observer designs
					are validated and compared for a representative test case.
